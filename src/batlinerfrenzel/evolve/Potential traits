Potential trait				Trade-offs
------------------------------------------------------------------	
Speed/sprint speed			(evasiveness vs energy efficiency)
Sight(range) / FOV?			(precision vs broadness)
Hearing?					
Damage(predator?)			(attack energy efficiency)
Constituition				(based off other stats?)
Energy cap(fat)				(Mass = more movement energy; more desirable as prey; speed penalty)
Metabolism rate/efficiency	(faster conversion = less efficient)
Energy loss to reproduction (offspring starting energy)
Offspring quantity			(quantity vs quality)


Causes of death
energy = 0
health = 0
